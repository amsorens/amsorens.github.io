            <h3>Brookhaven National Laboratory Newsroom:
	      RHIC/AGS Users' Meeting Emphasizes Diverse Workforce Opportunities</h3>
	    "Many of the nuclear physicists tuning in to the 2022 Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider 
	    (RHIC) & AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron) Users’ Meeting participated in a half-day 
	    workshop on June 8 dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and workforce 
	    development in the nuclear physics community. The June 8 DEI session brought together 
	    scientists who are enthusiastic about ensuring the community’s role in sustaining a 
	    pipeline of researchers from underrepresented communities."

	    <h3>DOE Office of Nuclear Physics Science Highlight:
	      Measuring the Speed of Sound in Dense Nuclear Matter</h3>
            "Nuclear physicists proposed a method to measure the speed of sound characterizing
	    matter created in nuclear collisions.
	    The suggested method of measurement uses fluctuations in numbers of detected particles.
	    These fluctuations are known as “cumulants,” and measurements of cumulants may reveal
	    the behavior of the speed of sound in heavy-ion collisions."
