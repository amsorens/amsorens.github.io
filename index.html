        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My research centers on bulk properties of dense strongly-interacting matter, often summarized in the form of its equation of state (EOS) or phase diagram. These thermodynamic properties can yield key insights into the elementary mechanisms governing nuclear matter which, while in principle described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), are most often inaccessible to direct QCD calculations.</p>

<p>Determining the QCD EOS in extreme environments — such as supernova explosions, neutron stars and their mergers, and, in laboratories on Earth, relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei — can help answer the following broad questions:</p>

<p>Does QCD matter undergo a first-order phase transition at finite baryon density? </p>
<p>How does the isospin dependence of the EOS (i.e., the nuclear symmetry energy) evolve with density and temperature? </p>
<p>How do the dominant nuclear matter degrees of freedom and their properties change as the thermodynamic variables are varied? </p>

<p>I aim to answer these questions using collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic speeds, which I model theoretically within semiclassical transport simulations. The simulations require various theoretical input as well as clever programming solutions. In fact, any comparisons to experimental data require the use of high-performance computing. Recently, the high computational cost of the simulations has begun to be addressed with machine learning methods. This research also benefits from close collaboration with complementary efforts, e.g., neutron star studies or ab initio calculations.</p>
