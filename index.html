      <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Physics at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), a
	scientific user facility for nuclear science funded by the U.S. Department of
	Energy and operated by the Michigan State University. As a theorist in nuclear
	physics, my research focuses on the thermodynamic properties of dense,
	strongly-interacting matter. These properties can provide insights
	into the fundamental mechanisms that govern such systems, which, although
	described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), remain largely
	inaccessible &mdash; with exceptions in a few limiting cases &mdash; to direct QCD
	calculations.
      </p>

      <p>Thermodynamic properties of a system are often summarized through its
	equation of state (EOS) or its phase diagram. Studying the QCD EOS in extreme
	environments &mdash; such as supernova explosions,
	neutron stars and their mergers, and relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei &mdash;
	can help answer several key questions:
	<ul>
          <li>Does QCD matter undergo a first-order phase transition at finite baryon
	    density? If so, where is the corresponding QCD critical point?</li>
          <li>How does the isospin dependence of the EOS evolve with density and
	    temperature?</li>
          <li>How do the dominant nuclear matter degrees of freedom and their properties
	    change as the thermodynamic variables are varied?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>I explore these questions by studying collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic
	speeds, which I model theoretically using semiclassical transport simulations.
	These simulations require a variety of theoretical inputs, and my research benefits
	from close collaboration with efforts in other areas of nuclear physics &mdash;
	such as neutron star studies and <i>ab initio</i> calculations &mdash; that aim
	to constrain the EOS and other properties of QCD matter. To facilitate wide-ranging
	explorations of dense nuclear matter behavor, I develop maximally
	flexible yet robust meta-models of the EOS, which are then implemented into the simulations.
      </p>
      <p> Developing the simulation framework is a team effort that requires efficient programming
	solutions to minimize computational costs. Constraining the QCD EOS and uncovering
	the QCD phase diagram relies on comparisons to experimental data, which require
	extensive use of high-performance computing. Recently, to address the high computational
	demands of these simulations, I have begun incorporating machine learning techniques into my work.
