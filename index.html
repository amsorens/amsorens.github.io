      <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Physics at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), a
	scientific user facility for nuclear science funded by the U.S. Department of
	Energy.
	My research focuses on the thermodynamic properties of dense,
	strongly-interacting matter.
	I explore these properties by studying collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic
	speeds, which I model theoretically using dynamic simulations.
      </p>
      <p> Beyond research, I am invested in building up the scientific community and broadening
	access to careers in science. To this end, I pursue directed actions through professional
	organizations, including as a member of multiple committees within the Division of Nuclear
	Physics of the American Physical Society.
	I am also a founding member of several initiatives connecting promising physics undergraduate
	students with research opportunities and providing them with directed mentoring.
