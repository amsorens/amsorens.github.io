      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Physics at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, a
	scientific user facility for nuclear science funded by the U.S. Department of
	Energy and operated by the Michigan State University. My research centers on
	thermodynamic properties of dense strongly-interacting matter, which are often
	summarized in the form of the nuclear matter equation of state (EOS) or the phase
	diagram. These thermodynamic properties can yield key insights into the elementary
	mechanisms governing nuclear matter which, while in principle described by quantum
	chromodynamics (QCD), are inaccessible - with a few exceptions in limiting cases -
	to direct QCD calculations.
      </p>

      <p>Determining the QCD EOS through studies of matter in extreme environments — such
	as supernova explosions, neutron stars and their mergers, and, in laboratories on
	Earth, relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei — can help answer the following
	broad questions:
	<ul>
          <li>Does QCD matter undergo a first-order phase transition at finite baryon
	    density?</li>
          <li>How does the isospin dependence of the EOS evolve with density and
	    temperature?</li>
          <li>How do the dominant nuclear matter degrees of freedom and their properties
	    change as the thermodynamic variables are varied?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>I aim to answer these questions using collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic
	speeds, which I model theoretically within semiclassical transport simulations.
	Since the simulations require various theoretical input, this research benefits
	from close collaboration with complementary efforts to constrain the EOS and other
	properties of QCD matter (e.g., neutron star studies or ab initio calculations).
	Devising the simulation framework is a team effort requiring efficient programming
	solutions to reduce the computational cost. Nevertheless, comparisons to
	experimental data always require the use of high-performance computing. Recently,
	the high computational cost of the simulations has begun to be addressed with
	machine learning methods. </p>
