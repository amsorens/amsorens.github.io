      <p> My research explores the thermodynamic properties of dense, strongly interacting matter, 
	offering insights into the fundamental mechanisms of the strong force. The underlying theory,
	quantum chromodynamics (QCD), is well established, yet direct calculations remain &mdash;
	with the exception of a few limiting cases &mdash; largely infeasible.
      </p>

      <p> Thermodynamic properties are encoded in the equation of state (EOS) and the phase diagram.
	Studying the EOS in extreme environments &mdash; such as supernovae, neutron stars and their
	mergers, and relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei &mdash; helps address critical questions:
	<ul>
          <li>Does strongly-interacting  matter undergo a first-order phase transition at finite baryon
	    density? If so, where is the corresponding QCD critical point?</li>
          <li>How does the isospin dependence of the EOS evolve with density and
	    temperature?</li>
          <li>How do nuclear matter degrees of freedom and their properties
	    change as the thermodynamic variables are varied?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>To investigate these questions, I model relativistic heavy-ion collisions using dynamic
	microscopic transport simulations. These require a variety of theoretical inputs, and my
	research benefits from close collaborations with neutron star studies and <i>ab initio</i>
	calculations that can independently constrain the EOS and properties of QCD matter.
	A lot of my research focuses on developing flexible EOS meta-models that can be
	implementated in simulations and enable broad explorations of the properties of
	dense nuclear matter.
      </p>
      <p> Developing the simulation framework is a team effort that requires efficient programming
	solutions to minimize computational costs. Constraining the QCD EOS and uncovering
	the QCD phase diagram relies on comparisons to experimental data, which require
	extensive use of high-performance computing. Recently, to address the high computational
	demands of these simulations, I have begun incorporating machine learning techniques into my work.
