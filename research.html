      <p> My research explores the thermodynamic properties of dense, strongly interacting matter.	
	These properties are encoded in the QCD equation of state (EOS).
	Studying the EOS in extreme environments &mdash; such as supernovae, neutron stars and their
	mergers, and relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei &mdash; helps address key questions
	about strongly-interacting systems:
	<ul>
          <li>Does QCD matter undergo a first-order phase transition at finite baryon
	    density? </li>
          <li>How does the isospin dependence of the EOS evolve with density and
	    temperature?</li>
          <li>How do nuclear matter degrees of freedom and their properties
	    change as the thermodynamic variables are varied?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>To investigate these questions, I model relativistic heavy-ion collisions using dynamic
	microscopic transport simulations. A lot of my research focuses on developing flexible EOS
	meta-models which constitute an adjustable input to the simulations. Constraining the QCD EOS and uncovering
	the QCD phase diagram relies on comparisons to experimental data, which in turn require
	extensive use of high-performance computing. Recently, to address the high computational
	cost of such analyses, I have begun incorporating machine learning techniques into my work.

            <h3>Locating the critical point for the hadron to quark-gluon plasma phase transition from finite-size scaling of proton cumulants in heavy-ion collisions</h3>
	    In this first analysis of experimental data to locate the QCD critical point in a range
	    consistent with modern theoretical predictions, we study fluctuations of the number of protons
	    produced in collisions of gold nuclei.
	    By adjusting the portion of the collision we analyze (using proton fluctuations measured
	    in different rapidity bin widths), we test how fluctuations scale with system size.
	    At collision energies above \( \sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 7.7~\rm{GeV}\), we observe that the data
	    follows Taylorâ€™s law, which suggests scale-free behavior: something expected near a critical point.
	    Our analysis indicates a critical point near a baryon chemical potential of \( \mu_B = 580 \pm 30~\rm{MeV} \).

	    <h3>Volume dependence of second-order baryon cumulant ratio in hadronic transport simulations</h3>
	    Using hadronic transport simulations of symmetric nuclear matter with mean-field interactions
	    in a box with periodic boundary conditions, I study the dependence of the ratio of variance to mean
	    on the considered subvolume and technical parameters of the simulation such as the number of
	    test particles per particle, mean-field lattice spacing, and smearing radius for density calculation.
	    I find that the results do not depend on the number of test particles (as long as it's large enough
	    to warrant a reliable density calculation) or the smearing radius.
	    Further, I show that the dependence on the microscopic scale -- the lattice spacing -- is suppressed as
	    compared to the dependence on the subvolume, which follows a power law.
	    Finally, I show that in the limit of an infinite subvolume and infinitesimal lattice spacing, the
	    simulation results approach the value expected from the underlying mean-field EOS.

	    <h3>Speed of sound from neutron stars to heavy-ion collisions</h3>
            In this project, we explored the compatibility of several neutron-star EOSs with a large peak
	    in the speed of sound squared as a function of density, favored by observational data,
	    with heavy-ion collision measurements.
	    To convert from a neutron-star EOS to an EOS applicable in heavy-ion collisions, we explored
	    a range of possible symmetry energy expansion coefficients and rejected coefficient sets
	    which led to acausal, unstable, or unphysical behavior of nuclear matter.
	    This in turn put a constraint on the high-density behavior of the symmetry energy, as can be
	    seen in the figure.
	    Using a flexible parametrization of density-dependent mean-field interactions, we then compared
	    results using the converted EOSs against experimental data, and we found that a neutron-star EOS
	    with a peak in the speed of sounds squared around twice the saturation density of nuclear  matter
	    is the most favored.

	    <h3>Bayesian analysis of Beam Energy Scan FXT data</h3>
            In this project, we used flexible density-dependent mean-field potentials in a Bayesian
	    analysis of STAR measurements of golg-gold collisions at \( \sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = \{3.0, ~4.5\}~\rm{GeV} \).
	    The flexibility of the potentials allowed for a meaningful exploration of the behavior of the EOS
	    at high baryon densities, leading to a Bayesian constraint that suggests a strong softening of the EOS
	    -- and possibly even a first-order phase transition -- at densities between 3~and~4 times the nuclear
	    saturation density (as indicated by the area with green vertical stripes in the figure). 
	    This nontrivial result at high densities was inaccessible in previous studies (see area with black horizontal
	    stripes in the figure), which used potentials parametrized using only a single parameter: the incompressibility
	    of nuclear matter at saturation, making it impossible to account for changes in the behavior of nuclear matter
	    at high densities.

	    <h3>Speed of sound from baryon cumulants in heavy-ion collisions</h3>
            In this work, I connected cumulants of baryon number to the isothermal speed of sound squared \(c_T^2 \)
	    and its derivative with respect to the baryon density.
	    Using experimental data (red triangles in the figure) compared to a model (purple stars), I showed that
	    the density-derivative of \(c_T^2 \) plateaus as collision energy is decreased (within the collider range
	    of the BES, \(\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} \geq 7.7~\rm{GeV}\)), but then dramatically increases at the HADES collision
	    energy of \(\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4~\rm{GeV}\).
	    This suggests a dramatic change in the behavior of the speed sound between these two energy regimes.

	    <h3>Flexible density-dependent EOS for hadronic transport</h3>
            In this work I developed flexible, relativistically-covariant vector density functional (VDF)
	    model of mean-field interactions. The model has been designed to allow for high flexibility of the EOS.
	    For applications to hadronic transport simulations of heavy-ion collisions, the EOS at low to moderate densities
	    is parametrized to reproduce the known properties of nuclear matter (such as the saturation density,
	    binding energy, and the location of the nuclear liquid-gas critical point), while at higher density the EOS
	    are fit to produce a postulated first-order phase transition.
	    In the figure, I show coexistence (solid lines) and spinodal (dashed lines) regions for the nuclear-liquid gas
	    phase transition (black) and several postulated phase transitions at high density (colorful lines) with varying
	    location of the critical point and/or width of the coexistence region.
